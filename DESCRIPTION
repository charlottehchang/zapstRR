Description: zapstRR enables conservation practitioners and other users of randomized response technique 
    to analyze univariate and multivariate RRT data. The analyses include: 
    univariate RRT modeling (prevalence and logistic regression),
    sum score modeling (the frequency of respondents possessing an ordinal sum of sensitive traits),
    and item response technique multivariate modeling. We supplement the analyses with a non-parametric bootstrap estimator,
    which can provide confidence limits for parameters when the dataset suffers from inadequate information.
    We also provide a power analysis for RRT survey design and a function to simulate data under the three RRT models.
